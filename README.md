FMgrains-
=========

3 waveform granulators + FM for MaxMSP. Each object has a slighlty different implemenation in order to generate aleatoric
values for the parameters. 

The C code contains step by step comments. The implementation of the object is quite simple. It uses 3 different wavetables 
for a Carrier, Modulator and a Window (Hanning). An aleatoric functions is specified to generate random numbers within 
boundaries. Feel free to modify the code and let me know if you do something cool with it. I'll be curious to listen ;)
