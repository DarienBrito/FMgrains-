FMgrains-
=========

3 waveform granulators + FM for MaxMSP. Each object has a slighlty different implemenation in order to generate aleatoric
values for the parameters. 

The C code contains step by step comments. The implementation of the object is quite simple. It uses 3 different wavetables 
for a Carrier, Modulator and a Window (Hanning). An aleatoric functions is specified to generate random numbers within 
boundaries. Feel free to modify/improve the code, and please share if you do something cool with it. I'll be curious to listen or read your code ;)
